    "An artificial neural network (ANN) or a simple traditional neural network aims to solve trivial tasks with a straightforward network outline. An artificial neural network is loosely inspired from biological neural networks. It is a collection of layers to perform a specific task. Each layer consists of a collection of nodes to operate together."

    "What are Neural Networks Used for?\n",
    "Neural networks have a broad spectrum of applications, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Image recognition. Platforms like Facebook employ neural networks for tasks such as photo tagging. By analyzing millions of images, these networks can identify and tag individuals in photos with remarkable accuracy.\n",
    "Speech recognition. Virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa utilize neural networks to understand and process voice commands. By training on vast datasets of human speech from various languages, accents, and dialects, they can comprehend and respond to user requests in real-time.\n",
    "Medical diagnosis. In the healthcare sector, neural networks are revolutionizing diagnostics. By analyzing medical images, they can detect anomalies, tumors, or diseases, often with greater accuracy than human experts. This is especially valuable in early disease detection, potentially saving lives.\n",
    "Financial forecasting. Neural networks analyze vast amounts of financial data, from stock prices to global economic indicators, to forecast market movements and help investors make informed decisions."
