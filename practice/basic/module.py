# firstly we created a module name hello.py than we just imported that here like the code below

# import hello
# hello.name("sumit")
# You can create an alias when you import a module, by using the as keyword:
# here we used (as) keyword 
import hello as hi
# print(dir(hi)) # we can use dir function and see what are the things present in that module
# hi.name("Sumit") # from hello import person1 as p #here we only took the required thing from our module
# print (hi.person1)
# hi.greeting("rahul")
