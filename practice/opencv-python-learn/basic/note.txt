first import cv2 
than read the image using cv2.imread() function

cv2.imread(filename[,flag])  
Parameters:
filename: Name of the file to be loaded
flag: The flag specifies the color type of a loaded image:
CV_LOAD_IMAGE_ANYDEPTH - If we set it as flag, it will return 16-bits/32-bits image when the input has the corresponding depth, otherwise convert it to 8-BIT.
CV_LOAD_IMAGE_COLOR - If we set it as flag, it always return the converted image to the color one.
C V_LOAD_IMAGE_GRAYSCALE - If we set it as flag, it always convert image into the grayscale.

it only has 1 or 2 for path 2 will get you greyscale and 1 will get default image or in place of path just write the thing 



than to show image using cv2.imshow() function
than we meed to wait otherwise it will destroy it in sec we can wait using cv2.waitKey(0) function 


OpenCV imwrite() function is used to save an image to a specified file. The file extension defines the image format. The syntax is the following:

cv2.imwrite(filename, img[,params]) => this is also like saving a image 
Parameters:
filename- Name of the file to be loaded

image- Image to be saved.

params- The following parameters are currently supported:

For JPEG, quality can be from 0 to 100. The default value is 95.
For PNG, quality can be the compress level from 0 to 9. The default value is 1.
For PPM, PGM, or PBM, it can be a binary format flag 0 or 1. The default value is 1.

Edge detection is a fundamental technique in image processing and computer vision. It identifies points in an image where brightness changes sharply or has discontinuities.
